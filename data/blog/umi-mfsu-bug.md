"umi": "3.5.41",

```ts
// config.ts
import { defineConfig } from 'umi'

export default defineConfig({
  // ...
  mfsu: {},
  // ...
})
```

if you open your chrome and open chrome devtools. then you run

```
npm run dev
```

In your chrome's url input: localhost:8000(or your define port)

you maybe find your page can't load in your chrome, just delete `mfsu`, then it will be fine.
